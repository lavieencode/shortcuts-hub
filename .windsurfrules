1. Always use the sh-debug.php code to log instead of error_log. When logging an error, always include the source file and line number of the originating error in the log. When logging information, such as an API call, always include as much detail as possible in a single log. The immediate benefit of this special logging functionality is that we can load it with as much info as we want in a single log, including full API requests AND responses.
